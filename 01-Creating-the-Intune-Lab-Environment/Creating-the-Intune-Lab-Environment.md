# Creating the Intune Lab Environment

## Introduction

Microsoft Intune is Microsoft's cloud-based endpoint management solution that enables organisations to manage and secure Windows, macOS, Android and iOS devices from a single administration portal.

In this chapter, a Microsoft Intune laboratory is created by adding a **Microsoft Intune Plan 1 Trial** to the existing **TechLab Microsoft 365** tenant that was configured in the previous Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Entra ID repositories.

This environment will be used throughout the remainder of this portfolio.

# Objectives

By completing this chapter, I will learn how to:

- Understand the purpose of Microsoft Intune
- Verify the licensing requirements
- Activate Microsoft Intune Plan 1 Trial
- Use an existing Microsoft 365 tenant
- Verify the subscription
- Access the Microsoft Intune Admin Center

---

# Prerequisites

Before starting this chapter, ensure you have:

- A Microsoft 365 tenant
- Global Administrator permissions
- Microsoft Entra ID configured
- Internet connection
- A supported web browser

---

# What is Microsoft Intune?

Microsoft Intune is Microsoft's cloud-based **Mobile Device Management (MDM)** and **Mobile Application Management (MAM)** solution.

It allows administrators to:

- Enrol devices
- Deploy applications
- Configure security policies
- Create compliance policies
- Perform remote device management
- Monitor managed devices

Microsoft Intune integrates directly with Microsoft Entra ID and Microsoft 365 to provide a modern cloud-based endpoint management solution.

# Microsoft Cloud Architecture

The TechLab environment uses the following Microsoft cloud architecture:

```text
Microsoft 365
      │
      ▼
Microsoft Entra ID
      │
      ▼
Microsoft Intune
      │
 ┌────┴────┐
 │         │
Windows  Android
```

Microsoft 365 provides productivity services.

Microsoft Entra ID manages identities and authentication.

Microsoft Intune manages devices.

---

# Licensing Requirements

Microsoft Intune requires an appropriate Microsoft licence before devices can be enrolled and managed.

Microsoft Intune can be licensed either as a standalone product or as part of selected Microsoft 365 subscriptions.

Common licensing options include:

- Microsoft Intune Plan 1
- Microsoft Intune Plan 2 *(advanced add-on features)*
- Microsoft 365 Business Premium
- Microsoft 365 E3
- Microsoft 365 E5

For this laboratory, **Microsoft Intune Plan 1 Trial** was used.

The trial provides everything required to build a practical Microsoft Intune laboratory and complete every exercise in this repository.

# Creating the Microsoft Intune Trial

Open the Microsoft Intune Trial page.

Sign in using your existing Microsoft 365 Global Administrator account.

---

# Using an Existing Microsoft 365 Tenant

After signing in, Microsoft detected my existing **TechLab365** Microsoft 365 tenant automatically.

Rather than creating a new Microsoft 365 environment, I continued using the existing tenant that had already been configured during my previous Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Entra ID repositories.

Using the existing tenant meant that Microsoft Intune could integrate immediately with Microsoft Entra ID, existing user accounts and Microsoft 365 services, providing a more realistic enterprise deployment.

# Selecting Microsoft Intune Plan 1 Trial

After confirming the tenant, Microsoft displayed the Microsoft Intune subscription options that were available for activation.

For this laboratory, I selected **Microsoft Intune Plan 1 Trial**.

Microsoft Intune Plan 1 provides the core endpoint management capabilities required throughout this repository, including device enrolment, compliance policies, configuration profiles, application deployment and endpoint security.

Using the trial licence allowed me to build a fully functional Microsoft Intune laboratory without requiring an Enterprise subscription.

# Configuring Renewal Settings

Before activating the trial, review the renewal settings.

For this laboratory, the following configuration was used:

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Licence Quantity | 1 |
| Subscription Length | 1 Month |
| Billing Frequency | Monthly |

After the trial was activated, recurring billing was configured to cancel automatically when the trial expires.

# Activating the Trial

Select **Start Free Trial**.

After a few moments Microsoft confirms that the Microsoft Intune Plan 1 Trial has been successfully added to the tenant.

# Verifying the Subscription

Return to the Microsoft 365 Admin Center.

Navigate to:

```text
Billing
    └── Your products
```

Verify that **Microsoft Intune Plan 1 Trial** appears in the list of subscriptions.

# Opening Microsoft Intune Admin Center

Microsoft Intune can be accessed using either of the following methods.

### Method 1

```text
https://admin.microsoft.com
```

Navigate to:

```text
Show all
    └── Admin centers
            └── Microsoft Intune
```

### Method 2

Open the Microsoft Intune Admin Center directly:

```text
https://intune.microsoft.com
```

Once provisioning has completed, the Microsoft Intune Admin Center opens successfully.

> **Note**
>
> During this laboratory, Microsoft Intune required a few minutes to complete the provisioning process before appearing in the Admin Centers list.

# Configuring Managed Google Play

After successfully accessing the Microsoft Intune Admin Center, I completed one final configuration before continuing with the remainder of the laboratory.

During the initial planning of this repository, I discovered that Android Enterprise management requires Microsoft Intune to be connected to **Managed Google Play** before Android devices can be enrolled or managed.

To verify the configuration, I navigated to:

```text
Tenant administration
    └── Connectors and tokens
            └── Managed Google Play
```

The portal confirmed that the connection had been established successfully and displayed a **Success** status.

This integration creates the trust relationship between Microsoft Intune and Google's Android Enterprise platform, enabling managed Google Play applications, Android work profiles and Android Enterprise device enrolment throughout the remainder of this repository.

During the configuration process, I initially attempted to register Managed Google Play using the tenant's default **onmicrosoft.com** account. I discovered that this approach was unsuitable because the registration requires a valid Google account to complete the Android Enterprise association.

I resolved the issue by completing the registration using my **TechLab365 organisational email address**, after which Microsoft Intune successfully connected to Managed Google Play.

Documenting this configuration within the laboratory preparation ensures that anyone following this repository can reproduce the environment without encountering the same issue.
