# Creating the Intune Lab Environment

## Introduction

Microsoft Intune is Microsoft's cloud-based endpoint management solution that enables organisations to manage and secure Windows, macOS, Android and iOS devices from a single administration portal.

In this chapter, a Microsoft Intune laboratory is created by adding a **Microsoft Intune Plan 1 Trial** to the existing **TechLab Microsoft 365** tenant that was configured in the previous Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Entra ID repositories.

This environment will be used throughout the remainder of this portfolio.

# What is Microsoft Intune?

Microsoft Intune is Microsoft's cloud-based **Mobile Device Management (MDM)** and **Mobile Application Management (MAM)** solution.

It allows administrators to:

- Enrol devices

# Microsoft Cloud Architecture

The TechLab environment uses the following Microsoft cloud architecture:

```text
Microsoft 365
      │
      ▼
Microsoft Entra ID
      │
      ▼
Microsoft Intune
      │
 ┌────┴────┐
 │         │
Windows  Android
```

Microsoft 365 provides productivity services.

Microsoft Entra ID manages identities and authentication.

Microsoft Intune manages devices.

# Licensing Requirements

Microsoft Intune requires an appropriate Microsoft licence before devices can be enrolled and managed.

Microsoft Intune can be licensed either as a standalone product or as part of selected Microsoft 365 subscriptions.

Common licensing options include:

- Microsoft Intune Plan 1
- Microsoft Intune Plan 2 *(advanced add-on features)*
- Microsoft 365 Business Premium
- Microsoft 365 E3
- Microsoft 365 E5

For this laboratory, **Microsoft Intune Plan 1 Trial** was used.

The trial provides everything required to build a practical Microsoft Intune laboratory and complete every exercise in this repository.

# Using an Existing Microsoft 365 Tenant

After signing in, Microsoft detects the existing TechLab tenant.

Using the existing tenant allows Microsoft Intune to integrate immediately with Microsoft Entra ID and Microsoft 365.

# Opening Microsoft Intune Admin Center

Microsoft Intune can be accessed using either of the following methods.

### Method 1

```text
https://admin.microsoft.com
```

Navigate to:

```text
Show all
    └── Admin centers
            └── Microsoft Intune
```

### Method 2

Open the Microsoft Intune Admin Center directly:

```text
https://intune.microsoft.com
```

Once provisioning has completed, the Microsoft Intune Admin Center opens successfully.

> **Note**
>
> During this laboratory, Microsoft Intune required a few minutes to complete the provisioning process before appearing in the Admin Centers list.
